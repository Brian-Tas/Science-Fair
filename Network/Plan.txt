Neural Network -
    - Neurons For All Inputs -
        - Sight -
            - x lines coming from face
            - x could be tied to possible eyesight statistic as well as amount of lines

        - Attributes -
            - Every attribute such as speed, size, eyesight, and other stats should have a neuron
    
    - Neuron Input/Output -
        - Synapsis -
            - Line connecting 2 neurons 
            - Genetic factor
            - Multiplies its transmitted signal by varing weight
