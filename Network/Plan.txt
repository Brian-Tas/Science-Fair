Neural Network -
    - Neurons For All Inputs -
        - Sight -
            - x lines coming from face
            - x could be tied to possible eyesight statistic as well as amount of lines

        - Attributes -
            - Every attribute such as speed, size, eyesight, and other stats should have a neuron

    - Neuron Output -
        - Weight -
            - Is multiplied by sum of all inputs
            - Multiplied sum is sent as output to proceeding neuron.
            - Genetic factor

            - Synapsis -
                - Line connecting 2 neurons 
                - Genetic factor
                - Multiplies its transmitted signal by varing weight
